# R_Python-Final-Project

## Synopsis
This is the final project for BIOS6640 Final Project: Using Twitter to mine information regarding Zika Virus.  The goal of this project is to see if public health officials can use Twitter to predict disease outbreaks.  We will accomplish this by a descriptive study of twitter mentions of Zika virus both geographically as well as over time.  

## Directory Structure
Given both R and Python were used for the completion of this project, code for both is provided

* R/fetched_tweets_analysis.R - this file contains the code used for the analysis  
* R/functions.R - this file contains two functions used to summarize counts  
  
* Python/twitter_streaming_git.py - this file contains code similar to that used by Caroline to pull streaming Twitter data  
* Python/dataread.py - this file contains code used to format JSON data from Caroline into a pandas dataframe and import into R for analysis
